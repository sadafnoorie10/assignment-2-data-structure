        "Q1) Discuss string slicing and provide examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "A1) String slicing in Python refers to extracting a portion of a string using index values. A string is treated as a sequence of characters, and each character has a unique index. The basic syntax for slicing is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "string[start:stop:step]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **start**: The starting index (inclusive). If omitted, slicing starts from the beginning of the string.\n",
        "- **stop**: The ending index (exclusive). If omitted, slicing continues to the end of the string.\n",
        "- **step**: The step value defines how many characters to skip. If omitted, the default step is 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Examples of String Slicing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Basic Slicing**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "   print(s[0:5])  # Output: Hello\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   Explanation: The slice `[0:5]` extracts characters starting at index 0 (H) up to, but not including, index 5 (comma).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Omitting Start or Stop**:\n",
        "   - Omitting the start index means slicing from the beginning:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(s[:5])  # Output: Hello\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Omitting the stop index means slicing until the end:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(s[7:])  # Output: World!\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Negative Indexing**:\n",
        "   - Python allows negative indices, where `-1` represents the last character.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(s[-6:-1])  # Output: World\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Step Parameter**:\n",
        "   - You can define a step to skip characters. For example, stepping by 2 extracts every second character:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(s[0:12:2])  # Output: Hlo ol\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - You can also reverse a string by using a negative step:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(s[::-1])  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- `s[2:5]`: Slices from index 2 to 4.\n",
        "- `s[:5]`: Slices from the start to index 4.\n",
        "- `s[5:]`: Slices from index 5 to the end.\n",

        "Q2) Explain the key features of lists in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A2) Lists in Python are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures. Here are some key features of lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Ordered Collection**:\n",
        "- Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added. Each element can be accessed by its index, starting from 0.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### 2. **Mutable**:\n",
        "- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list has been created. This flexibility allows for dynamic data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Heterogeneous Elements**:\n",
        "- Lists can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, other lists, etc.). This allows for great versatility in storing related data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Dynamic Sizing**:\n",
        "- Lists in Python can grow or shrink in size automatically. You don’t need to define a fixed size, and you can add or remove elements at any time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Support for Various Methods**:\n",
        "- Python lists come with a variety of built-in methods for common operations, such as:\n",
        "  - `append()`: Adds an element to the end of the list.\n",
        "  - `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specified index.\n",
        "  - `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
        "  - `pop()`: Removes and returns an element at a specified index (or the last element if no index is specified).\n",
        "  - `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.\n",
        "  - `reverse()`: Reverses the elements of the list in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Slicing**:\n",
        "- Lists support slicing, allowing you to access a subset of the list easily, similar to strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Nested Lists**:\n",
        "- Lists can contain other lists as elements, enabling the creation of multi-dimensional data structures (e.g., matrices).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **List Comprehensions**:\n",
        "- Python provides a concise way to create lists using list comprehensions, allowing for cleaner and more readable code. For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Iterability**:\n",
        "- Lists are iterable, meaning you can use loops (like `for` loops) to traverse through the elements easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "Here’s an example demonstrating some of these features:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Creating a list\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 'Hello', 3.5, [5, 6]]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing elements\n",
        "print(my_list[2])  # Output: Hello\n",
        "\n",
        "# Modifying elements\n",
        "my_list[1] = 10\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 'Hello', 3.5, [5, 6]]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Adding elements\n",
        "my_list.append('World')\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 'Hello', 3.5, [5, 6], 'World']\n",
        "\n",
        "# Removing elements\n",
        "my_list.remove(10)\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 'Hello', 3.5, [5, 6], 'World']\n",
        "\n",
        "# Slicing\n",
        "print(my_list[1:3])  # Output: ['Hello', 3.5]\n",
        "\n",
        "# List comprehension\n",
        "squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
        "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Lists are powerful tools in Python programming, offering flexibility and efficiency in managing collections of items. Their mutability, dynamic sizing, and rich set of methods make them suitable for various applications."

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Mutability**\n",
        "- **Lists**: Mutable (modifiable). You can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created.\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable (non-modifiable). Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Use Cases**\n",
        "- **Lists**: Suitable for collections of items that need to be modified, like stacks, queues, or other collections of data that may change over time.\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Ideal for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates (x, y), returning multiple values from a function, or as keys in dictionaries since they are hashable.\n",

        "Q5) Describe the key features of sets and provide examples and their use?\n",
        "\n",
        "A5) Sets in Python are a built-in data structure that provides an unordered collection of unique elements. They are particularly useful for storing items without duplicates and performing mathematical set operations. Here are the key features of sets, along with examples and use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features of Sets\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unordered**:\n",
        "   - Sets do not maintain any order for their elements. When you retrieve elements from a set, you cannot expect them to be in any specific order.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Unique Elements**:\n",
        "   - Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. Each element in a set is unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mutable**:\n",
        "   - You can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created. However, the elements themselves must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Sizing**:\n",
        "   - Sets can grow or shrink dynamically. You don’t need to specify a fixed size when creating a set.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Set Operations**:\n",
        "   - Sets support various mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which are useful for comparing collections of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - Sets are optimized for membership testing (checking if an item is in the set) and can provide faster performance for certain operations compared to lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Creating Sets\n",
        "\n",
        "You can create a set using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Creating a set using curly braces\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",

        "\n",
        "### Adding and Removing Elements\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method and remove elements using the `remove()` or `discard()` methods.\n",

        "# Removing elements\n",
        "my_set.remove(2)  # Raises KeyError if the element is not found\n",
        "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3, 4}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using discard (doesn't raise an error if the element is not found)\n",
        "my_set.discard(5)  # No error\n",
        "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3, 4}\n",
        "```\n",

        "Q6) Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in python programming?\n",
        "\n",
        "A6) Tuples and sets are two distinct data structures in Python, each with unique features and advantages. Here’s a discussion of their use cases in Python programming:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Use Cases of Tuples\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Fixed Collections of Data**:\n",
        "   - Tuples are ideal for representing fixed collections of related data. For example, you can use tuples to store coordinates (x, y), RGB color values, or points in space.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   point = (10, 20)  # A point in 2D space\n",
        "   color = (255, 0, 0)  # RGB color for red\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Return Multiple Values from Functions**:\n",
        "   - Tuples are often used to return multiple values from functions. This allows for a clean and simple way to pass back several related pieces of data.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def get_user_info():\n",
        "       return (\"Alice\", 30, \"Engineer\")\n",
        "   \n",
        "   name, age, profession = get_user_info()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Immutable Data**:\n",
        "   - Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, while lists cannot. This is useful when you need to create mappings based on composite keys.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   coordinates = {(10, 20): \"A\", (30, 40): \"B\"}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Integrity**:\n",
        "   - Use tuples when you want to ensure that the data remains constant and unchanged throughout your program. This is useful for configuration settings or constants.\n",

        "   config = (\"localhost\", 8080, \"db_name\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Unpacking and Iteration**:\n",
        "   - Tuples can be easily unpacked, making them convenient for iteration in loops or comprehensions.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_data = [(\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 25), (\"Charlie\", 35)]\n",

        "### Use Cases of Sets\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Removing Duplicates**:\n",
        "   - Sets are commonly used to remove duplicates from a list. By converting a list to a set, you automatically eliminate any repeated values.\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Analysis**:\n",
        "   - Sets are often used in data analysis tasks to find unique items in datasets or to compute differences between datasets.\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Configuration and Settings**:\n",
        "   - Sets can be used to manage configuration options that should not contain duplicates. For example, you could use a set to track active features in a software application.\n",

        "\n",
        "A8) In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable types, meaning their values cannot change over their lifetime. This immutability is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of a dictionary's structure and functionality. Here’s a discussion of the importance of dictionary keys being immutable, along with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of Immutable Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hashing**:\n",
        "   - Dictionaries in Python use a hash table under the hood to store key-value pairs. Each key is hashed to create a unique identifier for quick lookups. Mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries) can change their hash value if their content changes, which would disrupt the integrity of the dictionary. Immutable keys ensure that the hash value remains constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {('Alice', 30): \"Engineer\"}  # Using a tuple (immutable) as a key\n",
        "   print(my_dict[('Alice', 30)])  # Output: Engineer\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Attempting to use a list (mutable) as a key will raise a TypeError\n",
        "   # my_dict[[1, 2, 3]] = \"Invalid\"  # Uncommenting this line will raise a TypeError\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency and Predictability**:\n",
        "   - Using immutable keys ensures that once a key is set, it cannot be modified, making it predictable. This helps avoid bugs or unexpected behavior in programs, as the relationships between keys and values remain stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "   # If keys were mutable, changing a key would lead to inconsistencies\n",
        "   # my_dict[1] = \"uno\"  # Predictable behavior\n",
        "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\"}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Supports Complex Data Structures**:\n",
        "   - Immutable keys allow for the use of composite data types like tuples or frozensets as dictionary keys. This capability enables the creation of more complex data structures, such as dictionaries with tuples representing coordinates or sets of unique items.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Using tuples as keys for a dictionary\n",
        "   coordinates = {(1, 2): \"Point A\", (3, 4): \"Point B\"}\n",
        "   print(coordinates[(1, 2)])  # Output: Point A\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Using frozensets (immutable sets) as keys\n",

        "   - The immutability of keys can lead to performance benefits. Since the hash values of immutable keys do not change, Python can efficiently compute and store these hashes in the dictionary's underlying data structure, resulting in faster lookups.\n",

        "5. **Avoiding Key Collisions**:\n",
        "   - If mutable keys were allowed, changes to the key would lead to hash collisions or loss of access to the original value associated with that key. By enforcing immutability, Python avoids potential issues with key collisions, ensuring data integrity.\n",
